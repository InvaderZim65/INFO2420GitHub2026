    <h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>

	<hr>

    <h2>Website: Jami Lin - http://www.jamilin.com/</h2>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">1. What was your first impression of this site?:</strong><br>
	<br>
        My first impression was that this website is extremely bright and very busy. The bright green background and the rainbow colors caught my eye immediately, but it felt a little cluttered with too many different font sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">2. How does this site organize the flow of information?:</strong><br>
		<br>
        The site organizes information from the top down. It has a big banner at the top, followed by a navigation bar with links, and then columns of pictures and text below that explain the different services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">3. Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?:</strong><br>
		<br>
        The structure is a little confusing to me. There are a lot of different topics mixed together, like skin care and "Galactic Spirit," which makes it hard to know exactly what the main point of the business is right away.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">4. Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?:</strong><br>
		<br>
        I think the graphics distract from the site. The header image has text written over a photo which makes it look messy, and the cutout photos of the owner look a little bit amateur compared to modern professional sites.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">5. How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
	reasonable?:</strong><br>
	<br>
        The home page loaded very fast. Since it is mostly simple images and text without heavy animation, the load time was very reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">6. Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
	image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?:</strong><br>
	<br>
        The text was somewhat hard to read. The white text on the bright green background is straining on the eyes, and the text inside the navigation bar buttons is a bit small.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">7. Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
	navigation well done?:</strong><br>
	<br>
        Yes, the site has a navigation bar across the middle of the page. It is very colorful (rainbow style), which makes it easy to see, but the colors are very intense.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">8. Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
	the pages?:</strong><br>
	<br>
        The site definitely has a repeated look and feel. It uses a lot of neon greens and a rainbow color palette that matches the "Chakras" and "ColorAlchemy" themes mentioned on the home page.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">9. How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?:</strong><br>
		<br>
        The site does not seem to respond well to smaller windows. When I made the window smaller, the images didn't stack or move; they just stayed in the same place, which means you have to scroll sideways.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="color: blue;">10. What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?:</strong><br>
		<br>
        The most unusual thing about this site is the combination of topics. It is very unique to see a site that offers "Organic Skin Care" and "Quantum Mayan Insights" in the same place.
